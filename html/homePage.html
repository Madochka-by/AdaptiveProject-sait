              The client had already worked on SEO promotion. They left the
              previous team due to a lack of feedback and dissatisfaction with
              the results. That's why the customer immediately indicated that
              engagement and a quick response to queries were important to him.
              This wasn't an issue for us. We believe the project's growth is

              <span class="blue">Google</span> prioritizes content that is
              useful to users because the system's goal is to answer queries as
              accurately as possible. This is influenced by the quality of the
              text and the authority of the site, i.e., how many and what types
              of resources link to it.

            The main limitation in this case was the law prohibiting the
            promotion of certain services. For instance, we could only
            indirectly promote mining because it was banned in the Russian
            Federation until 2023. However, we quickly made up for it when the
            law changed.

              in these areas and studied the demand for these services simultaneously. First, specialists parsed all the semantics, and then

              we found a problem with the bounce rate on the informational text, so we decided to reduce it. Because, when users quickly
               leave a page, it negatively impacts the site's position: search engines begin to consider it useless. To address this, we 
               added more information about services and prices. <br><br> This way, our page will not be mistaken for an informational page. In 
               parallel, we wrote articles for the blog. The articles are usually about starting a business in a particular region, details

              We actively work with links, building up two-level ones. At the start of the project, <span class="bold">the site had 627 external links</span>, 
              while competitors <span class="bold">averaged 4,922</span>. Therefore, one of the most important tasks was to gradually approach the average value 
              of competitors. We evenly distributed new links between the home page, services, and news, so that, in the eyes of search  
              engines, the build-up would appear natural and not raise suspicion (shh!). We obtained links to sites that our target audience 
              may be interested in, such as news portals and information resources about business and legal services. We also prioritized 
              the domain zone — .ru was our preference.

            Content remains a priority for this project. We are blogging on the site, writing articles on 
            relevant topics, and building links. Overall, we are steadily completing the assigned tasks. 
            There has been growth, even over the last three months. For all tracked queries, we are now in 
            the top 21 on Yandex and in the top 28 on Google.

            We dedicate it to anyone working on promotion who is not seeing results. This includes corporate
             websites, businesses providing services, SEO and marketing specialists. And anyone who thinks their
              niche is too narrow. We hope that you learned something useful from our experience. Remember that 
              templates do not always work and that quality promotion requires a team of specialists to pay special
               attention to the project and develop a personal strategy. It's important to collaborate with clients,
                with the team providing expertise and clients being ready to answer questions from specialists. You 
                can see examples in our recent case studies (*wink wink*).
